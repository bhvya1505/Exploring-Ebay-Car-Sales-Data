# Exploring-Ebay-Car-Sales-Data
This project uses pandas to clean and analyze data.

Here we work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The original data set uses web scarping and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data). However, a few changes have been made to the original data set so it runs in a hosted environment. The modified data set can be found in the repository as **autos.csv**.

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings. 

The Jupyter Notebooks file **Basics.ipynb** includes details about the project along with the codes and their explanation.
